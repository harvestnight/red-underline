# Red-Underline

This is an open source repo for girls(and boys) to write about your uncomfortable experience and expose the undesirable ones. 
It’s public and can be modified by any users.
You can check the *.md* file in directories sorted by area to get information you want. 

## To Contributors
We appreciate various kinds of information. Thank you for sharing your private experience and making a contribution here
to prevent a possible horrible event. Meanwhile, do notice that the information you offered may well be seen by others, 
please write down your REAL and effective experience.</br>

## Usage
Simply edit the *.md* file of the locale of your experience and commit it.
> **New to .md(MarkDown) file?**</br>
  `MarkDown` is more like a **programming** language which does not function like *.txt* or *.docx*.</br>
  If you are not familiar with md, you can check the source code to learn how to use it(quite simple actually).</br>
  You will be using source code mode(editing mode) once you click `Edit` button.</br>
  But guess that you can just copy&paste the text and change the content :)

AND...It would be great if you use the following style when writing: </br>
**Number of the event**: [year][month][day]-[area code]-[number]</br>
number = last number in the file you’re editing +1
</br>

### **Example:**

## About the Owner
Wrote this in lame English out of some stupid habit. (Or maybe just because I don’t think that anyone will ever use it.)
I will keep supporting this repo if someone’s commit the very first information.</br>
Thanks again.
