## A repo that will not have to exist one day hopefully 

This is an open source repo for girls(and boys) to write about your uncomfortable experience.
We appreciate various kinds of information, and thank you for making a contribution here
to prevent a possible horrible event.
Do notice that your information may well be seen by others, 
please write down your REAL and effective experience.</br>
Thank you again.

## Usage
Simply edit the .md file of the locale of your experience and commit it.
> **New to .md(MarkDown) file?**</br>
  `MarkDown` is more like a **programming** language which does not function like *.txt* or *.docx*.</br>
  If you are not familiar with md, you can check the source code to learn how to use it(Quite simple actually).</br>
  You will be using source code mode(editing mode) once you click `Edit` button.</br>
  But guess that you can just copy&paste the text and change the content :)

AND...It would be great if you use the following style: </br>
Number of the event: [year][month][day]-[area code]-[event number]</br>
event number = last event number in this file +1
</br>

### **Example:**
